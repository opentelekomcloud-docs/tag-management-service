What Is Tag Management Service?
===============================

Tag Management Service (TMS) s an efficient, convenient, visualized service that allows you to centrally manage tags and categorize cloud resources across regions and services.

You can group cloud resources by usage, owner, or environment.

:ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0071335169__fig476135744>` shows how tags work. In this example, two tags are assigned to each cloud resource. Each tag contains a key and a value. The key of one tag is **Owner**, and that of another tag is **Usage**.

You can quickly search for and filter cloud resources based on the tags added to them. For example, if you define tags to specify resource owners or usage and attach these tags to your resources, you can easily filter these resources by owner or usage.

TMS provides the following functions:

-  Resource tag management: Allows you to classify resources with tags. You can easily manage one tag or multiple tags at the same time in a visualized table.
-  Resource search: Allows you to search for resources across services and regions with one or more tags.
-  Predefined tag management: Allows you to create, import, and export predefined tags. You can efficiently plan tags based on your services.

.. note::

   TMS is free of charge.
