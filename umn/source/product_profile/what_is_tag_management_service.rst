What Is Tag Management Service?
===============================

Tag Management Service (TMS) helps you centrally categorize and manage cloud resources across regions and services with tags.

You can group cloud resources by usage, owner or the environment where the resources are deployed.

   **Figure 1** Example tags

:ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0071335169__fig476135744>` shows how tags work. In this example, you assign two tags to each cloud resource. Each tag contains a key and a value that you define. The key of one tag is **Owner**, and that of another tag is **Usage**. Each tag has a value.

You can quickly search for and filter cloud resources based on the tags added to them. For example, if you define a set of tags to specify resource owners or usage and attach these tags to your resources, you can easily filter these resources by owner or usage.

TMS provides the following functions:

-  Resource management allows you to classify resources by tag. You can easily manage one tag or multiple tags at the same time in a visualized table.
-  Searching for resources: Search for resources across services and regions regions by tag or by tag set.
-  Predefined tag management: You can create, import, or export predefined tags. By predefining tags, you can plan tags according to your services to effectively manage tags.

.. note::

   TMS is free of charge.
