Tag Management Service
======================

Tag Management Service (TMS) is a visualized service for quickly tagging and categorizing cloud services across fast and unified cross-regions.

Tags are used to identify cloud resources. When you have cloud resources of the same type, you can use tags to classify cloud resources by dimension, for example, usage, owner, or environment.

:ref:`Figure 1 <en-us_topic_0071335169__fig476135744>` shows how tags work. In this example, you assign two tags to each cloud resource. Each tag contains a key and a value that you define. The key of one tag is **Owner**, and that of another tag is **Usage**. Each tag has a value.

You can quickly search for and filter specific cloud resources based on the tags added to them. For example, you can define a set of tags for cloud resources in an account to identify their owners and usage, making resource management easier.

TMS provides the following functions:

-  Managing resources: Add tags to resources as needed to classify resources. TMS provides you with a visualized table to manage resource tags, including editing tags in batches.
-  Searching for resources: Search for resources across services and regions regions by tag or by tag set.
-  Predefined tag management: You can create, import, or export predefined tags. By predefining tags, you can plan tags according to your services to effectively manage tags.

.. note::

   TMS is currently free of charge.
