User Permissions
================

You have permissions to manage users and resources.

-  You add users to user groups so that users can inherit permissions attached to user groups which they are in.
-  You can control which resources and what actions a user can access.

To use resource tags, you must have the corresponding permissions on the cloud service. Otherwise, the tag operations on cloud resources may not take effect.

Contact the system administrator to assign the corresponding cloud service permissions to the user group to which you belong.

For details about TMS user permissions, see :ref:`Permissions <tms_01_0009>`.
