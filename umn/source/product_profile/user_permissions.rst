User Permissions
================

Permissions for the system are divided into user management and resource management permissions.

-  User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Users with resource management permissions can manage the operations performed on cloud service resources.

To use resource tags, you must have the corresponding permissions on the cloud service. Otherwise, the tag operations on cloud resources may not take effect.

Contact the system administrator to assign the corresponding cloud service permissions to the user group to which you belong.

For details about TMS user permissions, see :ref:`Permissions <tms_01_0009>`.
