Application Scenarios
=====================

This section describes two typical application scenarios for TMS.

Centralized Resource Management
-------------------------------

TMS allows you to search among a wealth of cloud resources with specific tags. You can review, modify, and delete tags in a unified manner.

Resource Migration
------------------

If you need to migrate large numbers of resources, you can create or import predefined tags in batches for these resources. You can also export predefined tags to batch modify them. This improves the accuracy and efficiency of resource migration while eliminating the need to repeatedly set tags.

-  Creating predefined tags: You can create predefined tags before the migration, and then add these tags to the migrated resources.

-  You can batch import predefined tags and add them to migrated resources. You can also export predefined tags for editing.
