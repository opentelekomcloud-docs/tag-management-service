Accessing TMS
=============

The cloud platform provides a web-based service management platform. You can use either of the following ways to access TMS:

-  APIs

   To integrate TMS into a third-party system for secondary development, call APIs to access TMS. For details, see *Tag Management Service API ReferenceTag Management Service API Reference*.

-  Management console

   The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your compute, storage, and other cloud resources. Tenants and users who have registered with the cloud platform can access TMS by selecting **Tag Management Service** under **Management & Deployment** on the management console.
