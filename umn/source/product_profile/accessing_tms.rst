Accessing TMS
=============

The public cloud provides a web-based service management platform. You can access TMS through the management console or HTTPS-compliant application programming interfaces (APIs).

-  Using APIs

   To integrate TMS on the public cloud into a third-party system for secondary development, use APIs to access TMS. For details, see the *Tag Management Service API Reference*.

-  Through the management console

   The management console is a web user interface for you to manage your compute, storage, and other cloud resources. Tenants and users who have registered with the public cloud can access TMS by selecting **Tag Management Service** under **Management & Deployment** on the management console.
