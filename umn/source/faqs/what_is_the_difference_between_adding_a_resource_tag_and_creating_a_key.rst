What Is the Difference Between Adding a Resource Tag and Creating a Key?
========================================================================

When you add a resource tag, if you set only the tag key, the value is empty by default, and the tag will be associated with a resource after it is added. You can add tags in batches.

If you create a key, a column with the key as the header will be added to the resource tag list, and the value is set to Not Tagged by default. To attach tags with the key created to resources, add values for the key in the rows that contain the target resources. If you do not add any values for the key, the key will not be associated with any resources.
