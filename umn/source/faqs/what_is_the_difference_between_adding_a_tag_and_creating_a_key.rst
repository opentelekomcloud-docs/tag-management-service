What Is the Difference Between Adding a Tag and Creating a Key?
===============================================================

When you add a tag, if you set only the tag key, the value of the tag is empty value by default. After you click **OK**, a specific tag will be bound to the cloud resource. You can add tags in batches.

Creating a key adds a key list to the resource tag list. By default, the status of every **Value** in the key list is **Not Tagged**, so no specific tags are bound to any cloud resources. You can add specific values to the list to generate new tags and bind them to cloud resources.
