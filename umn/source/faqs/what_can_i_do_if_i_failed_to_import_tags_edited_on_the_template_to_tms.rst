What Can I Do If I Failed to Import Tags Edited on the Template to TMS?
=======================================================================

You may have used the Excel to edit the tag template.

The predefined tag import function allows you to import the .csv file exported from a third party to TMS. The encoding format of the .csv file must be UTF-8.

Predefined tag importation does not support .csv files that have been modified in Excel files. Attempting to import such files will produce garbled characters and result in an importation failure. To edit a .csv file, open it with notepad.
