Adding Tags to Cloud Resources
==============================

You can add tags to cloud resources in either of the following ways:

-  Adding tags on the TMS console

   When you need to tag a batch of cloud resources, you are advised to add tags on the TMS console.

-  Adding tags on the consoles of other cloud services

   When you use the resources of a specific service, you can add tags on the corresponding service console. For new cloud resources, you can configure tag items when configuring parameters.

   .. note::

      You are advised to use the predefined tag function. To tag a cloud resource, you can select a created predefined tag from the drop-down list, without entering a key and value for the tag. This reduces the errors and improves the efficiency.

Constraints
-----------

-  Each resource supports up to 10 key-value pairs.
-  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one tag value. If the tag value you add is the same as an existing one on the resource, the new value overwrites the old value.
-  You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for **Key** and **Value**, respectively. Both **Key** and **Value** can contain only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).

Adding Tags on the TMS Console
------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search criteria.

   For details, see :ref:`Searching for Cloud Resources <en-us_topic_0056266264>`.

#. Click **Search**.

#. In the search result list, select the cloud resource to which you want to add tags and click **Manage Tag** in the upper left.

#. In the **Add Tag** area, enter a tag key and a tag value.

   You can also directly select predefined tags from the drop-down list.

#. Click **OK**.

Adding Tags on the Consoles of Other Cloud Services
---------------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Service List**, select the cloud service for which you want to add tags. For details about supported services and supported resource types, see :ref:`TMS and Other Services <en-us_topic_0056858747>`.

#. On the displayed console of the selected cloud service, click the resource to which you want to add a tag.

#. Select the **Tags** tab.

#. Click **Add Tag**.

#. In the displayed **Add Tag** dialog box, enter a tag key and a tag value.

   You can also directly select predefined tags from the drop-down list.

#. Click **OK**.

Checking Whether a Tag Takes Effect
-----------------------------------

If you have added a tag to a resource, you can check whether the tag takes effect by search for the resource with the added tag.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search criteria.

   Set the region and resource type as needed.

   For **Resource Tag**, enter the tag that has been added to the resource.

#. Click **Search**.

   The resource is displayed in the **Search Result** area.
