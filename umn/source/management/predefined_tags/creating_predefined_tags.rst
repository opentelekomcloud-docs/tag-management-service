Creating Predefined Tags
========================

You can use predefined tags to quickly identify cloud resources. To create a predefined tag, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Click **Predefined Tags**.

#. In the upper right corner of the displayed page, click **Create Tag**.

   The **Create Tag** dialog box is displayed.

#. Configure **Key** and **Value**.

#. Click **OK**.

   The predefined tag is created and displayed on the top of the list.

**Follow-up Procedure**
-----------------------

When tagging resources, you can select a predefined tag from the drop-down list of the tag text box without the need to enter a key and value pair.

For example, if there is a predefined tag whose key is **Usage** and value is **Project1**, you can directly select the key and value pair form the drop-down list of the tag text boxes.
