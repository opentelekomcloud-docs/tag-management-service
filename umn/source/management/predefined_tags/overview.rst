Overview
========

By using predefined tags, you can plan and create tags in advance from the service perspective, or import or export tags in batches. When using cloud service resources, you can quickly associate predefined tags with cloud resources.

This topic describes how to search for, delete, import, or export predefined tags.

Constraints and Limitations
---------------------------

-  If the created predefined tag is the same as an existing predefined tag, the existing predefined tag is overwritten. If only keys are the same and values are different, the new predefined tag is created.

-  You can create up to 500 predefined tags.
-  You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for **Key** and **Value**, respectively. Both **Key** and **Value** can contain only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).
-  A null value cannot be included in a predefined tag.
