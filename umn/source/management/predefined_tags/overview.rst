Overview
========

TMS allows you to create tags in advance and attach created tags to resources as needed. You can also import or export tags in batches.

This section describes how to search for, create, delete, import, or export predefined tags.

Constraints and Limitations
---------------------------

-  Predefined tags cannot be identical. Either their keys or values must be different. If you create a predefined tag that is identical to an existing predefined tag, the existing predefined tag will be overwritten.

-  Up to 500 predefined tags can be created for each account.
-  You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for **Key** and **Value**, respectively. Both **Key** and **Value** can contain only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).
-  A null value cannot be included in a predefined tag.
