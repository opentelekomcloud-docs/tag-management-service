Overview
========

TMS allows you to create tags in advance for service management. You can import or export tags in batches. You can attach predefined tags to resources as needed.

This section describes how to search for, create, delete, import, or export predefined tags.

Constraints and Limitations
---------------------------

-  Predefined tags must be different from each other either in tag keys or in tag values.

-  Up to 500 predefined tags can be created for each account.
-  You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for **Key** and **Value**, respectively. Both **Key** and **Value** can contain only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).
-  A null value cannot be included in a predefined tag.
