Creating a Key
==============

To add tags with the same tag key to multiple resources, you can use the tag key creation function.

After being created, the tag key is displayed in the list and all default statuses in the key column are **Not tagged**. You can add a tag value to a cloud resource in the list to make the tag take effect.


Creating a Key
--------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. In the upper left corner of the page, click |image1|, and then click **Management & Deployment** > **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search options.

   For details, see :ref:`Searching for Resources <en-us_topic_0056266264>`.

#. Click **Search**.

#. Click **Create Key** in the upper left corner of the list displayed.

#. Specify a key.

   A tag key can contain a maximum of 36 characters, including only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).

#. Click **OK**.

   After the key is created, a column with the key as the header will be added to the list.

   If you create a key but do not add any values, it will be invalid and will be deleted from the list after you refresh the page.

Follow-up Procedure
-------------------

To add a tag to a resource when a tag key has been created, perform the following steps:

#. In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click **Edit**.

   The tag list enters the editable state.

#. Click **+** in the row that contains the target resource.

#. Enter a tag value.

#. Click |image2|

   After the resource tag is modified, the cloud resources can be managed based on the new tag.
