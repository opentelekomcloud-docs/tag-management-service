Creating a Key
==============

To add tags with the same tag key to all resources, you can use the tag key creation function.

After being created, the tag key is displayed in the list and all default statuses in the key column are **Not tagged**. You can add a tag value to a cloud resource in the list to make the tag take effect.


Creating a Key
--------------

#. Sign in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search options.

   For details, see :ref:`Searching for Resources <en-us_topic_0056266264>`.

#. Click **Search**.

#. Click **Create Key** in the upper left corner of the list displayed.

#. Specify a key.

   The key can contain a maximum of 36 characters, including only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).

#. Click **OK**.

   The created tag key is displayed in the tag display column.

   If you create a key but do not bind it to any cloud resource, it will be invalid and will not be displayed in the resource key list after you refresh the page.

Follow-up Procedure
-------------------

To add a tag to a resource when a tag key has been created, perform the following steps:

#. In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click **Edit**.

   The tag list enters the editable state.

#. Locate the row containing the cloud resource whose tag you want to add and click |image1|.

#. Enter a tag value.

#. Click |image2|.

   After the resource tag is modified, the cloud resources can be managed based on the new tag.
