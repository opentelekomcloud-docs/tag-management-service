Modifying Resource Tags
=======================

Modifying a Tag for a Cloud Resource
------------------------------------

When modifying the tag for a single resource, you can modify only the cloud resources that contain the tag.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search criteria.

#. Click **Search**.

   For the search results, you can perform two operations: edit and view.

#. In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click **Edit**.

#. (Optional) Set the key display list.

   If the key of the tag to be modified is not displayed in the list, perform the following steps:

   a. In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click |image1|.

   b. Select the key of the tag to be modified from the drop-down list.

      You are advised not to select more than 10 keys to display.

#. Locate the row containing the cloud resource whose tag you want to modify and click |image2|.

#. Enter a new tag value.

#. Click |image3|.

   After the resource tag is modified, the cloud resources can be managed based on the new tag.

#. (Optional) In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click |image4|.

   The cloud resource tag list is refreshed and the list refresh time is updated.

Modifying Tags for Multiple Cloud Resources
-------------------------------------------

You can only batch modify the cloud resources containing the tags. For details, see the following steps.

.. important::

   Exercise caution when modifying tags in batches. After a tag value is modified, the tag values of corresponding cloud resources will be modified and cannot be recovered.

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search criteria.

#. Click **Search**.

#. Select the cloud resources whose tags are to be modified and click **Manage Tag** above the list.

#. In the **Edit Tag** area, specify new values for tags.

#. Click **OK**.

   After the resource tag is modified, the cloud resources can be managed based on the new tag.

#. (Optional) In the upper right corner of the **Search Result** list, click |image5|.

   The cloud resource tag list is refreshed and the list refresh time is updated.
