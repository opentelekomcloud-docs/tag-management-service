Overview
========

TMS allows you to easily classify and search for your resources with tags. You can manage multiple tags in a list view.

This section describes how to query resources by tag, create tag keys, and update, modify, or delete resource tags.

Constraints and Limitations
---------------------------

-  Up to 10 tags can be specified to query for resources at a time.
-  To search for specified tags, entering a key is mandatory but entering a value is optional.
-  Each resource supports up to 20 key-value pairs.
-  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one tag value.
-  You can enter a maximum of 36 and 43 characters for **Key** and **Value**, respectively. Both **Key** and **Value** can contain only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).
