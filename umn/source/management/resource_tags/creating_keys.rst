Creating Keys
=============

To add a tag with the same tag key to all resources in the search result list, you can use the tag key creation function.

After being created, the tag key is displayed in the list and all default statuses in the key column are **No tagged**. You can add a tag value to a cloud resource in the list to make the tag take effect.

Creating a Key
--------------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Under **Management & Deployment**, select **Tag Management Service**.

#. Set the resource search criteria.

#. Click **Search**.

#. In the search result list, select the target resource and click **Create Key** in the upper left corner.

#. Specify a key.

   The key can contain a maximum of 36 characters, including only digits, letters, hyphens (-), at signs (@), and underscores (_).

#. Click **OK**.

   The created tag key is displayed in the tag display column.

   If you create a key but do not bind it to any cloud resource, it will be invalid and will not be displayed in the resource key list after you refresh the page.

Follow-up Procedure
-------------------

To add a tag to a resource when a tag key has been created, perform the following steps:

#. Click **Edit** in the upper right corner of the search result list.

   The tag list enters the editable state.

#. Locate the row containing the cloud resource whose tag you want to add and click |image1|.

#. Enter a tag value.
