Searching for Resources
=======================

Before adding tags, you must search for available cloud resources. Cloud resource tags will be displayed on the TMS console where you can manage them, including adding, deleting, and modifying tags.

TMS provides the following search options:

-  **Region**
-  **Resource Type**
-  (Optional) **Resource Tag**

   -  You can search for up to 10 tags at a time.
   -  To search for specified tags, entering a key is mandatory but entering a value is optional.
   -  When you specify the search criteria, the cloud resources you want to search for must meet all of the key criteria and at least one of the value criteria.
