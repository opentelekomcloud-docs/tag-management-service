Obtaining a Project ID
======================

A project ID needs to be specified in the URIs of some APIs. Therefore, you need to obtain the project ID before calling APIs. The following procedure describes how to obtain a project ID:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click the username and select **My Credential** from the drop-down list.

   On the **My Credential** page, view project IDs in the project list.

   In multi-project scenarios, expand the region, and obtain your sub-project ID from the **Project ID** column.
